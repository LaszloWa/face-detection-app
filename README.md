This is the frontend part of the final project of the udemy course 'The Complete Web Developr in 2020: From Zero to Mastery'.
The backend and database live on a heroku server.

The app allows a user to enter an image-url and faces in the image will then be highlighted using a box, thanks to the clarifai-api.

The basic app was built by coding along with the course.

After completing the app by following the course, I implemented the following features myself:
- Profile page
- Profile delete option
- Dark mode/ Light mode
- Styling

This is the frontend part of the final project of the udemy course 'The Complete Web Developer in 2020: From Zero to Mastery'.
The frontend, backend ([link](https://github.com/LaszloWa/face-detection-app-backend)) and database are ive on a heroku server.

The app allows a user to enter an image-url and faces in the image will then be highlighted using a box, thanks to the clarifai-api.

The basic app was built by coding along with the course.

After completing the app by following the course, I implemented the following features myself:
- Profile page (included adding new route on backend)
- Profile delete option (included adding new route on backend)
- Dark mode/ Light mode
- Banner informing the user what data was stored, why it is being stored and how they can delete it.
- Styling
